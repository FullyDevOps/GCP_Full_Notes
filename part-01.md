### **Part 1: Account & Billing Setup**
*   **The Foundation:** Before *anything* exists in GCP, you need a billing anchor. This isn't just "paying Google"; it's the root of cost control, resource ownership, and financial governance.
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Google Account:** Your personal login (e.g., `yourname@gmail.com` or `yourname@yourcompany.com`). *This is NOT your billing entity.*
    *   **Billing Account:** The **critical financial container**. Created *once* per organization (or cost center). Links Google Accounts (users) to payment methods (credit card, invoice). **All projects consume resources under a Billing Account.**
    *   **Organization Resource (Optional but ESSENTIAL for Enterprise/DevOps):** Represents your *entire company* (`yourcompany.com`). Created by verifying domain ownership. **Mandatory** for:
        *   Centralized IAM policy (Org-level roles)
        *   Organization-level logging/monitoring
        *   Hierarchical resource management (Folders, Projects)
        *   Centralized billing (single invoice for all projects)
        *   **DevOps Impact:** Without an Org, you lack enterprise-scale governance. *You will manage this.*

*   **Setting Up (Step-by-Step for DevOps):**
    1.  **Create Google Account:** Use a *dedicated service account* (e.g., `gcp-admin@yourcompany.com`) **NOT** a personal Gmail. *Why?* Accountability, avoids "Bob left the company" lockouts.
    2.  **Create Billing Account:**
        *   Console: `Billing > Manage Billing Accounts > Create Account`
        *   **Crucial:** Name it meaningfully (e.g., `prod-billing-us-central1`, `dev-sandbox`). *Avoid "Primary".*
        *   **Payment:** Use a corporate credit card or set up invoicing. *Never use personal cards for company resources.*
    3.  **(Highly Recommended) Create Organization Resource:**
        *   Console: `IAM & Admin > Settings > Create Organization`
        *   Requires domain verification (DNS TXT record).
        *   **Set the Billing Account** for the Org *immediately* after creation.
    4.  **Link Projects to Billing:** Every project *must* be linked to a Billing Account *before* using billable resources. Done during project creation or later via `Billing > Link a Project`.

*   **DevOps Pro Tips:**
    *   **Dedicated Billing Admins:** Restrict Billing Account creation/modification to a tiny group (e.g., FinOps team + Lead DevOps). *Principle of Least Privilege starts here.*
    *   **Multiple Billing Accounts:** Use separate accounts for *Production*, *Development*, *Sandbox* environments. Enables strict cost separation and budgeting.
    *   **Billing Account ID:** Note this UUID (`XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX`). You'll use it in CLI (`gcloud billing accounts list`) and scripts.

---

### **Part 2: Free Tier, Billing Accounts, Budget Alerts**
*   **Free Tier ≠ Free Forever:**
    *   **$300 Credit:** New users get $300 for 90 days. *Expires!* Track via `Billing > Budgets & alerts`.
    *   **Always Free Tier:** Limited perpetual usage (e.g., 2GB Cloud Storage, 1 f1-micro VM per month in specific regions). *Check the [detailed list](https://cloud.google.com/free) – it's NOT "free GCP".*
    *   **DevOps Reality:** Free Tier is for *learning only*. **Production workloads WILL incur costs.** Never assume "free" means unlimited.

*   **Budget Alerts (Your Financial Safety Net):**
    *   **Why Critical for DevOps:** You *will* spin up expensive resources (big VMs, BigQuery scans). Alerts prevent $10k+ surprise bills.
    *   **How to Set Up:**
        1.  `Billing > Budgets & alerts > Create Budget`
        2.  **Scope:** Select Billing Account (or specific projects/folders if using Org).
        3.  **Budget Amount:** Start low (e.g., $50 for dev, $500 for prod sandbox). *Adjust as you learn usage patterns.*
        4.  **Alert Rules:** **MANDATORY:** Set `100%` of budget + `50%` + `90%`. *Don't wait for 100% to alert!*
        5.  **Notifications:** **Email ALL relevant people** (DevOps team, managers, FinOps). Use a *distribution list* (e.g., `gcp-billing-alerts@yourcompany.com`).
    *   **Expert Level:** Use **Pub/Sub notifications** for budgets. Trigger automated actions (e.g., shutdown non-prod resources via Cloud Functions when budget hits 95%).

*   **DevOps Pro Tips:**
    *   **Per-Environment Budgets:** Prod, Staging, Dev, Sandbox *each* need separate budgets/alerts.
    *   **Cost Allocation Tags:** Apply labels (e.g., `env=prod`, `team=backend`, `app=checkout`) **during resource creation**. Critical for granular cost reporting later.
    *   **Automate Budget Checks:** Use `gcloud alpha billing budgets list` in CI/CD pipelines to fail builds if costs are spiking unexpectedly.

---

### **Part 3: Navigating the GCP Console**
*   **More Than Just Clicks:** The Console is your visual control plane. Mastery saves hours.
*   **Key Areas:**
    *   **Navigation Menu (Hamburger Icon):** **Your lifeline.** Organized by product category (Compute, Storage, Networking, IAM, Tools, etc.). *Learn the structure.*
    *   **Project Selector (Top Bar):** **CRITICAL.** Always verify you're in the *correct project* before clicking! Projects are isolated; actions in `project-a` don't affect `project-b`.
    *   **Search Bar:** Type product names (`Cloud Run`, `BigQuery`) or resource names. *Faster than navigating menus.*
    *   **Resource Hierarchy View:** `IAM & Admin > Settings` shows your Org > Folders > Projects structure visually.
    *   **Activity Log (Operations > Activity):** Tracks *who did what and when*. **Your first stop for "Who deleted that VM?!"**
    *   **Cloud Shell (>_ Icon):** Browser-based terminal with `gcloud` pre-authenticated. **Use this constantly for quick CLI tasks.**

*   **DevOps Console Mastery:**
    *   **Customize Navigation:** Pin frequently used services (Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, IAM).
    *   **Resource Filtering:** Use the filter bar on list pages (e.g., VM Instances) with labels (`env=prod`, `owner=devops-team`).
    *   **Export to CSV:** Found useful data? Click `⋮ > Export to CSV` for ad-hoc analysis.
    *   **Incognito Mode:** Test IAM permissions by opening Console in incognito as a different user.

---

### **Part 4: Projects, Resources & Organization Hierarchy**
*   **The Core Structure:** GCP resources exist within a strict hierarchy. **This is foundational for security and cost management.**
*   **Hierarchy (Top-Down):**
    1.  **Organization Resource (`org.example.com`):** *The root.* Represents your company. **Requires domain ownership.** *Not all accounts have this (free tier users don't).*
    2.  **Folders (`/prod`, `/dev`, `/finance-app`):** **Organizational units.** Used to:
        *   Group projects logically (by department, environment, application).
        *   Apply **inheritable IAM policies** and **organization policies** (e.g., "Only allow VMs in us-central1").
        *   Set **folder-level budgets** (if using Organization-level billing).
        *   *Crucial for scaling beyond a few projects.*
    3.  **Projects (`my-prod-app`, `dev-sandbox-01`):** **The fundamental unit of resource organization and isolation.**
        *   **Resource Container:** All GCP resources (VMs, buckets, databases) belong to *exactly one* project.
        *   **Billing Anchor:** Projects are linked to a Billing Account.
        *   **IAM Boundary:** IAM policies are set *per project* (though inherited from Org/Folders).
        *   **Isolation:** Resources in Project A *cannot* directly access resources in Project B without explicit IAM grants.
        *   **Project ID vs. Project Name:** ID is globally unique and immutable (e.g., `my-awesome-prod-123456`). Name is human-readable (editable). **ALWAYS use Project ID in scripts/configs.**
    4.  **Resources (VMs, Buckets, etc.):** The actual compute/storage/services.

*   **Why Hierarchy Matters for DevOps:**
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant `roles/compute.admin` on a *Folder* containing all dev projects, instead of granting it 20 times on individual projects.
    *   **Policy Enforcement:** Set an Org Policy at the Organization level: `constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess: false` (Block public IPs on VMs). Inherited by *all* projects.
    *   **Cost Management:** Apply budgets at Folder level (e.g., `/prod` budget = $10k/month).
    *   **Disaster Recovery:** Isolate environments. Deleting `/dev` folder doesn't affect `/prod`.
    *   **Multi-tenancy:** Separate projects for different teams/apps within the same Org.

*   **DevOps Best Practices:**
    *   **Project Naming Convention:** `[env]-[app]-[region]` (e.g., `prod-ecommerce-us`, `dev-jenkins-eu`). *Avoid generic names like "project1".*
    *   **Dedicated Projects:** One project per major application/environment. *Avoid "monolithic" projects.*
    *   **Sandbox Projects:** Isolated projects for experimentation. Apply strict budget limits and auto-shutdown policies.
    *   **Project Lifecycle:** Use `gcloud projects create` + `gcloud projects delete` in automation. **ALWAYS delete unused projects!** (They incur *minimal* costs but clutter management).

---

### **Part 5: Core Billing Concepts (SKUs, Cost Reports, Billing Exports)**
*   **Beyond "The Bill":** Understanding costs is a core DevOps/FinOps responsibility.
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit):** **Google's internal product code for a specific billable resource.** *This is how Google tracks every penny.*
        *   Example: `N1 STANDARD PREEMPTIBLE IN USE` (SKU ID: `B959B530`), `US Standard Storage` (SKU ID: `311F30-6A5454`).
        *   **Why DevOps Cares:** Cost reports break down by SKU. To optimize, you need to know which SKUs are expensive (e.g., `BigQuery Query Processing` vs `BigQuery Storage`).
    *   **Cost Report (Console: `Billing > Reports`):**
        *   **Group By:** Your primary tool. Group by:
            *   `Project` (Who's spending?)
            *   `Service` (Compute Engine? BigQuery? Storage?)
            *   `SKU` (Which *specific* resource type?)
            *   `Labels` (e.g., `env=prod`, `team=backend` - **MOST IMPORTANT FOR DEVOPS**)
        *   **Filters:** `Date Range`, `Cost Type` (Usage, Credits, Taxes), `Labels`.
        *   **Charts:** Visualize trends (daily, weekly).
    *   **Billing Export (The Game Changer):**
        *   **What:** Automatically exports **detailed, daily** billing data to a BigQuery dataset.
        *   **Why Essential:**
            *   **Granular Analysis:** Query costs by label, project, SKU, time with SQL. `SELECT project.id, SUM(cost) FROM billing_data GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC`
            *   **Custom Dashboards:** Build internal cost dashboards (Data Studio, Looker).
            *   **Anomaly Detection:** Write scripts to alert on cost spikes (`WHERE cost > LAG(cost) OVER (ORDER BY usage_start_time) * 2`).
            *   **Chargeback/Showback:** Allocate costs accurately to teams/apps.
        *   **Setup:** `Billing > Billing export > BigQuery export`. **Enable this on ALL billing accounts immediately.** Choose a dedicated project (e.g., `billing-analytics`).

*   **DevOps Cost Optimization Tactics:**
    *   **Identify Zombie Resources:** Query BigQuery export for VMs with 0% CPU for 7+ days. `gcloud compute instances delete` them.
    *   **Right-Sizing:** Compare `n1-standard-4` vs `n2-standard-2` costs for same workload using export data.
    *   **Sustained Use Discounts (SUD):** Automatic discount (up to 30%) for VMs running >25% of the month. *No action needed, but monitor usage.*
    *   **Committed Use Discounts (CUD):** Prepay for VM/CPU/GPU capacity (1-3 years) for up to 57% discount. **Requires forecasting.** *DevOps must collaborate with Finance.*
    *   **Preemptible VMs / Spot VMs:** Up to 91% discount for interruptible workloads (batch jobs, CI/CD). **Use in non-critical environments.**

---

### **Part 6: Cloud SDK (gcloud, gsutil, bq)**
*   **Your DevOps Command Line:** The SDK is **non-negotiable** for automation and efficiency. Forget clicking in the Console for routine tasks.
*   **Installation:**
    *   **Preferred:** Install the **standalone SDK** (not via apt/yum). Follow [official instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
    *   **Why:** Ensures latest version, consistent across OSes, avoids distro package issues.
    *   **Cloud Shell:** Already has SDK pre-installed and authenticated. *Use it for quick tasks.*
*   **Authentication (The MOST Critical Step):**
    *   `gcloud auth login`: For **user accounts** (your personal login). Opens browser. *Use for initial setup/testing.*
    *   `gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=sa-key.json`: For **service accounts** (automation). **THIS IS HOW YOUR SCRIPTS/CI RUN.**
    *   `gcloud auth list`: See active credentials.
    *   **Project Context:** `gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID` - Sets the *default* project for subsequent commands. **ALWAYS SET THIS.**
    *   **Region/Zone:** `gcloud config set compute/region us-central1` & `gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a` - Avoids specifying `--region`/`--zone` everywhere.
*   **Core Commands (DevOps Daily Drivers):**
    *   **`gcloud`:** The universal CLI.
        *   `gcloud projects list` - See all accessible projects.
        *   `gcloud compute instances list` - List VMs.
        *   `gcloud iam service-accounts list` - List service accounts.
        *   `gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com` - Enable APIs (critical for new projects!).
        *   `gcloud config configurations create devops` - Manage *multiple* environments/profiles (prod, dev).
    *   **`gsutil`:** Cloud Storage CLI.
        *   `gsutil cp localfile gs://my-bucket/` - Copy file to bucket.
        *   `gsutil mb gs://new-bucket-name` - Make bucket.
        *   `gsutil acl set private gs://my-bucket` - Set bucket to private.
        *   `gsutil -m rsync -r ./local/dir gs://bucket/` - **Fast** recursive sync (use `-m` for multi-threading).
    *   **`bq`:** BigQuery CLI.
        *   `bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.table` LIMIT 10"` - Run a query.
        *   `bq mk my_dataset` - Create dataset.
        *   `bq load my_dataset.my_table ./data.csv schema.json` - Load data.
*   **Expert Level for DevOps:**
    *   **Scripting:** Use `gcloud` in Bash/Python scripts. Parse JSON output: `gcloud compute instances list --format=json | jq '.[].name'`.
    *   **Automation:** Run `gcloud` commands in CI/CD pipelines (Cloud Build, GitHub Actions) using **service account keys** (safely!).
    *   **Configurations:** `gcloud config configurations` to switch between `prod`, `staging`, `dev` contexts seamlessly.
    *   **Dry Runs:** `gcloud compute instances delete my-vm --dry-run` - See what *would* happen.
    *   **API Exploration:** `gcloud beta interactive` - Explore APIs interactively.

---

### **Part 7: Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
*   **The Bedrock of Security:** Misconfigured IAM is the #1 cause of cloud breaches. **You WILL own this as a DevOps engineer.**
*   **Core Model:**
    *   **Principals:** *Who* is accessing? (Users, Groups, Service Accounts, G Suite domains).
    *   **Resources:** *What* are they accessing? (Projects, Buckets, VMs, Datasets).
    *   **Permissions:** *What action* can they perform? (Lowest level, e.g., `storage.buckets.create`). **Rarely granted directly.**
    *   **Roles:** **Collections of Permissions.** The unit you actually grant.
        *   **Primitive Roles (Legacy - AVOID):** `Owner`, `Editor`, `Viewer`. **TOO PERMISSIVE.** Never use in production. `Editor` has `compute.instances.delete` – dangerous!
        *   **Predefined Roles:** **USE THESE.** Granular, service-specific roles (e.g., `roles/compute.admin`, `roles/storage.objectViewer`, `roles/bigquery.user`). Find them via `gcloud iam roles list --project=YOUR_PROJECT`.
        *   **Custom Roles:** Create your *own* role with *only* the permissions needed. **ESSENTIAL for least privilege.** (e.g., `custom-role-gcs-log-writer` with only `storage.objects.create` on specific buckets).
    *   **Policies:** Bind **Principals** to **Roles** on a **Resource** (Project, Folder, Org). Stored as JSON.
*   **How IAM Works (The Critical Flow):**
    1.  A **Principal** (e.g., `user:alice@company.com`) makes a request to access a **Resource** (e.g., `gs://prod-logs-bucket`).
    2.  GCP checks **ALL IAM policies** applicable to that resource:
        *   Policy directly on the bucket? (Least common)
        *   Policy on the **Project** containing the bucket? (Most common)
        *   Policy on a **Folder** containing the project? (Inherited)
        *   Policy on the **Organization**? (Inherited, strongest)
    3.  If *any* policy grants the Principal a Role that contains the required **Permission** for the action (`storage.objects.create`), access is granted. **DENY is NOT explicit** – if no role grants the permission, access is denied.
*   **Key Principles for DevOps:**
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant the *minimum* permissions needed for *as short a time as possible*. **This is your mantra.**
    *   **Hierarchy Inheritance:** Policies set at higher levels (Org, Folder) apply to all resources below. *Be careful!* A permissive Org policy can override strict project policies.
    *   **Binding Order:** Bindings are additive. If a user is in a group with `Viewer` and also directly granted `Editor`, they get `Editor`.
    *   **Service Accounts are Principals:** They are the #1 identity for *workloads*, not humans. Manage them like crown jewels.

*   **Managing IAM (Console & CLI):**
    *   **Console:** `IAM & Admin > IAM`. Shows all principals and their roles *at the current resource level* (Project by default). **Check "Include Google-managed roles" to see system roles.**
    *   **CLI - View:**
        *   `gcloud projects get-iam-policy YOUR_PROJECT_ID` - Shows *full* policy JSON (critical for audits).
        *   `gcloud projects get-iam-policy YOUR_PROJECT_ID --flatten="bindings[].members" --format='table(bindings.role)'` - List roles simply.
    *   **CLI - Modify:**
        *   `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \ --member="user:alice@company.com" \ --role="roles/storage.admin"`
        *   `gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding...` (Use with extreme caution!)
        *   **Better:** Use `gcloud projects get-iam-policy > policy.yaml`, edit the YAML, then `gcloud projects set-iam-policy YOUR_PROJECT_ID policy.yaml`. *Enables version control of IAM!*

*   **DevOps IAM Mastery:**
    *   **Avoid Project Editors:** Replace with granular predefined/custom roles.
    *   **Custom Roles are Your Friend:** Create `custom-role-k8s-node` with *only* permissions needed for GKE nodes. Avoid `roles/compute.viewer` + `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` if possible.
    *   **Folder-Level IAM:** Apply `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator` to a DevOps group on the `/dev` folder. They can *create* projects but not delete them.
    *   **Audit Logs:** `gcloud logging read "resource.type=project AND protoPayload.methodName=SetIamPolicy"` - Find who changed IAM.
    *   **IAM Conditions:** **Advanced but powerful.** Grant access only if condition is true (e.g., `resource.name.startsWith("prod-") AND request.time < timestamp("2023-12-31T00:00:00Z")`). Use for time-bound access or resource naming constraints.

---

### **Part 8: Service Accounts**
*   **The Identity of Your Workloads:** VMs, Cloud Functions, Kubernetes pods, CI/CD runners – they all need identities. **Service Accounts (SAs) are NOT user accounts.**
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Format:** `sa-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (e.g., `devops-runner@my-prod-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
    *   **Project-Level:** Created *within* a project. Belong to that project.
    *   **Principals:** SAs *are* principals. You grant IAM roles *to* SAs (e.g., grant `roles/storage.admin` to `devops-runner@...` so it can manage buckets).
    *   **Keys:** Credentials for SAs. **HIGH SECURITY RISK.**
        *   **JSON Key File:** Used by applications/scripts (`gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=key.json`). **Treat like a password!**
        *   **Never commit keys to Git!** Use secret managers (Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
        *   **Rotate keys regularly** (90 days max). Delete unused keys immediately.
    *   **Impersonation:** **Critical for security.** A *user* or *SA* can temporarily *act as* another SA without having its key.
        *   **Why:** User logs in -> Needs prod access -> Impersonates `prod-deployer-sa` (which has strict prod permissions) -> Does deployment -> Session ends. User *never* had direct prod access.
        *   **Mechanisms:**
            *   `gcloud auth application-default login --impersonate-service-account=SA_EMAIL`
            *   `gcloud config set auth/impersonate_service_account SA_EMAIL`
            *   In code: `from google.auth import impersonated_credentials`
        *   **Prerequisite:** The *original* principal (user/SA) must have `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on the *target* SA.

*   **Creating & Managing SAs (DevOps Workflow):**
    1.  **Create SA:** `gcloud iam service-accounts create devops-runner \ --display-name="DevOps CI/CD Runner" \ --project=my-project`
    2.  **Grant Roles to SA:** `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my-project \ --member="serviceAccount:devops-runner@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \ --role="roles/storage.admin"`
    3.  **(Optional) Create Key:** `gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \ --iam-account=devops-runner@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com` **-> STORE SECURELY -> ROTATE/DELETE LATER.**
    4.  **Use SA:** In Cloud Build, set `serviceAccount: projects/my-project/serviceAccounts/devops-runner@...`. In GKE, use Workload Identity (preferred over keys!).

*   **Critical DevOps Best Practices:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for SAs:** Give the SA *only* the permissions its workload *absolutely needs*. `roles/editor` on a SA is a massive red flag.
    *   **Avoid Default Compute Engine SA:** The default SA (`project-number-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`) has broad permissions. **Create dedicated SAs for VMs.**
    *   **Workload Identity (GKE):** **MANDATORY for Kubernetes.** Maps Kubernetes service accounts to GCP service accounts *without keys*. Eliminates key management. *This is how you run secure pods.*
    *   **Key Rotation Policy:** Automate key rotation (e.g., Cloud Build step that creates new key, updates secret manager, deletes old key).
    *   **Audit SA Usage:** `gcloud logging read "protoPayload.authenticationInfo.serviceAccountKeyName:*"` - Find where SAs are used.
    *   **Disable Unused SAs:** `gcloud iam service-accounts disable SA_EMAIL`
    *   **Impersonation > Keys:** **Always prefer impersonation over key files** for user workflows (e.g., local `gcloud` commands). Reserve keys *only* for workloads that can't impersonate (legacy apps).

### **Why This Matters for Your DevOps Role: Automation, Security, Cost Control**

1.  **Automation Foundation:** `gcloud`, IAM, Service Accounts, and Projects are the bedrock of *everything* you automate (Terraform, Ansible, Cloud Build). You can't script GCP without this.
2.  **Security is Your Job:** IAM misconfiguration causes breaches. Understanding hierarchy, least privilege, and SA security is non-optional. You *are* the gatekeeper.
3.  **Cost Ownership:** DevOps engineers directly impact cloud spend (resource choices, scaling, zombie resources). Budget alerts and cost exports are your tools to be financially responsible.
4.  **Operational Excellence:** Navigating the hierarchy, using the Console efficiently, and understanding billing data are daily tasks for troubleshooting and optimization.
5.  **Production Readiness:** Free tier is for learning. Real DevOps means managing production environments with proper Org structure, budgets, and security from day one.

**Next Steps for Your Preparation:**

1.  **DO NOT SKIP HANDS-ON:** Set up a personal GCP account (use Free Tier $300). **Create an Organization.** Make Folders (`/dev`, `/prod`). Create Projects. Link Billing. Set Budget Alerts. Break things and fix them.
2.  **Automate Everything:** Write a script using `gcloud` to:
    *   Create a new project.
    *   Enable required APIs.
    *   Create a dedicated SA for that project.
    *   Grant minimal roles to the SA.
    *   Set up a budget alert.
3.  **Break IAM:** Intentionally give a SA too many permissions. Try to exploit it. Then lock it down properly.
4.  **Analyze Costs:** Enable Billing Export to BigQuery. Write a query showing cost by label (`env`).
5.  **Implement Workload Identity:** Set up a simple GKE cluster where a pod uses a dedicated SA via Workload Identity to read a Cloud Storage bucket.
